# isomorphic-react-template /reflux

A starting template for building an isomorphic single page app using [react.js](http://www.reactjs.org) on [express](http://www.expressjs.com) with a [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/) architecture.

> This is the **reflux branch** where I'm trying to move to a Flux architecture with [refluxjs](https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs). The example app is similar to that included in [flux-react-router-example](https://github.com/gaearon/flux-react-router-example) and it does not render sever-side (yet).

*Go back to the [master branch](../master) to read more about this project.*
